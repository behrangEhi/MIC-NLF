# Feature Selection for Classification on Incomplete Data: Non-negative latent factor-incorporated duplicate MIC

This repository contains an implementation of the "Non-negative latent factor-incorporated duplicate MIC" feature selection method for classification on incomplete data. This method is based on the paper titled "An improved feature selection method for classification on incomplete data: Non-negative latent factor-incorporated duplicate MIC" (cite the paper here).

## Introduction

The "Non-negative latent factor-incorporated duplicate MIC" method is designed to handle feature selection in the presence of incomplete data. It incorporates non-negative latent factors and duplicate MIC (Maximal Information Coefficient) to identify relevant features for classification tasks.

This implementation aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient way to apply the method to your own datasets and classification problems.

## Methodology

In this implementation, the "Non-negative latent factor-incorporated duplicate MIC" method is carried out in the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing: Handle missing values in the dataset using appropriate techniques such as imputation or deletion.
1. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF): Apply NMF to decompose the dataset into non-negative latent factors.
1. Duplicate MIC calculation: Compute the MIC scores between the latent factors and the target variable.
1. Feature selection: Select the top-ranked features based on the MIC scores and the duplicate MIC criterion.
1. Classification: Perform classification using the selected features.

## Usage

To use this implementation, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies (list them if any) using `pip` or any package manager.
1. Prepare your dataset by handling missing values appropriately.
1. Modify the code to load your dataset and adjust any parameters or configurations according to your needs.
1. Run the feature selection method and evaluate the selected features using classification algorithms of your choice.
1. Analyze the results and interpret the importance of the selected features for your classification task.

Make sure to provide clear instructions on how to run and customize the code for different datasets. You can also include examples or code snippets to demonstrate the usage.
